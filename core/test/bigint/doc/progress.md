# BigInt Test Implementation Progress

## Current Status
- [x] Basic test framework setup
- [x] Implementation of logical operation tests (bigint_logic_tests.cc)
- [x] Implementation of addition comparison tests (prompt_eng_add.cc)
- [x] Support for multiple limb sizes (8, 16, 32, 64 bits)
- [x] Edge case testing
- [x] Memory management implementation

## Pending Tasks
- [ ] Performance optimization for large bigint sizes
- [ ] Additional edge cases for addition tests
- [ ] Documentation improvements
- [ ] Code coverage analysis
- [ ] Integration with CI/CD pipeline

## Known Issues
1. Memory leaks in error cases need to be addressed
2. Performance degradation with very large bigint sizes (>50000 bits)
3. Limited test coverage for negative numbers

## Next Steps
1. Implement performance optimizations
2. Add more comprehensive error handling
3. Expand test coverage
4. Add documentation for test cases
5. Integrate with automated testing pipeline
