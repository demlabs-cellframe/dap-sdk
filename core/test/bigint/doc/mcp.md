# BigInt Test Master Control Program (MCP)

## Overview
The BigInt test suite implements comprehensive testing for big integer operations in the CELLFRAME-SDK, focusing on both logical operations and arithmetic operations with cross-library validation.

## Test Implementation Details

### Addition Tests (prompt_eng_add.cc)
```cpp
class BigIntAdditionTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int>
```
- **Purpose**: Validates addition operations against Boost implementation
- **Parameters**:
  - Limb sizes: 8, 16, 32, 64 bits
  - Bigint sizes: 1 to 50000 bits
- **Test Cases**:
  - Zero addition
  - Single bit operations
  - Full bit operations
  - Edge cases
  - Large number operations

### Logical Operation Tests (bigint_logic_tests.cc)
```cpp
class BigIntLogicTest : public ::testing::Test
```
- **Purpose**: Validates logical operations (AND, OR, XOR)
- **Parameters**:
  - Limb sizes: 8, 16, 32, 64 bits
- **Test Cases**:
  - Basic logical operations
  - Edge cases
  - Cross-limb operations

## Test Execution Flow

1. **Initialization**
   - Set up test environment
   - Initialize test parameters
   - Allocate required memory

2. **Test Execution**
   - Run parameterized tests
   - Execute cross-library comparisons
   - Validate results

3. **Cleanup**
   - Free allocated memory
   - Reset test environment
   - Generate test reports

## Error Handling

### Expected Errors
- Memory allocation failures
- Invalid parameter combinations
- Overflow conditions
- Underflow conditions

### Error Recovery
- Graceful cleanup on failure
- Memory leak prevention
- State restoration

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Usage
- Dynamic allocation based on bigint size
- Efficient memory management
- Cleanup after each test case

### Execution Time
- Optimized for large number operations
- Parallel test execution where possible
- Timeout handling for long operations

## Integration Points
