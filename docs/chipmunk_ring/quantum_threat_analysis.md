**Quantum Resource Requirements:**
```
Ring Size | Classical Ops | Quantum Ops | Logical Qubits | Physical Qubits (100:1)
----------|---------------|-------------|----------------|------------------------
16        | 16            | 4           | 4              | 400
64        | 64            | 8           | 6              | 600

- Performance: 2-5× computational overhead
- Size: 1.5-3× larger commitments

### Strategy 3: Hybrid Anonymity Amplification

**Approach**: Combine multiple anonymity techniques for defense in depth.

**Components**:
1. **ChipmunkRing base layer**: Current implementation
2. **Classical anonymity layer**: Mixing protocols, onion routing
3. **Quantum-resistant layer**: Additional post-quantum anonymity

**Benefits**:

- Backward compatibility with existing systems

## Practical Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (2025-2030)

1. **Deploy with larger rings**: Use 256+ participants for new systems
2. **Implement ring rotation**: Change ring composition every 24-48 hours
3. **Monitor quantum progress**: Track quantum computing milestones
4. **Prepare upgrade paths**: Design systems for easy anonymity upgrades

### Medium-term Preparations (2030-2050)

1. **Implement hybrid schemes**: Deploy quantum-resistant anonymity layers
2. **Upgrade to larger rings**: Migrate to 1024+ participant rings
3. **Enhanced monitoring**: Real-time quantum threat detection

4. **Continuous adaptation**: Ongoing evolution with quantum technology

## Conclusion

ChipmunkRing's anonymity faces genuine quantum threats, particularly from Grover-based attacks on small rings. However, with proper planning and incremental improvements, the scheme can maintain practical anonymity for decades to come. The key is proactive enhancement rather than reactive patching.

**Critical Timeline**: Anonymity for rings ≤64 participants likely vulnerable by 2030-2035. Immediate action required for quantum-resistant deployment.
