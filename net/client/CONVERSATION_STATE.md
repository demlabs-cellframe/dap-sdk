# Conversation State - HTTP2 Client Architecture

## Current Status: ✅ ARCHITECTURE COMPLETE

### What We Accomplished
1. ✅ **Analyzed existing lite-client** and found it inadequate
2. ✅ **Designed 3-layer architecture** (Client-Stream-Session)
3. ✅ **Resolved multiple streams vs single stream** debate → Single stream
4. ✅ **Analyzed protocol switching approaches** → Callback-based switching
5. ✅ **Compared performance approaches** → Composition wins
6. ✅ **Discussed role-based architecture** → Callbacks define role
7. ✅ **Analyzed client vs server differences** → Universal structures
8. ✅ **Performed detailed field audit** → Removed duplications
9. ✅ **Confirmed server compatibility** → Stream/Session work for both modes

### Key Architectural Decisions Made
- **Single stream per session** (not multiple parallel streams)
- **Callback-based protocol switching** (not union types)
- **Universal structures** for client/server (callbacks define role)
- **Composition performance approach** (1+N function calls)
- **Channel dispatch via array lookup** (channel_callbacks[id])
- **No cyclic dependencies** (they were false problems)
- **Cancellation = immediate socket close** (not graceful)

### Current Architecture State
```
Client (API, config, stats) 
  ↓ owns
Session (socket, timers, SSL)
  ↓ creates  
Stream (protocols, parsing, channels)
```

### Files Created/Modified
- `net/client/include/dap_http2_client.h` - Complete API
- `net/client/include/dap_http2_stream.h` - Complete API  
- `net/client/include/dap_http2_session.h` - Complete API
- `net/client/dap_http2_client.c` - Stub implementations
- `net/client/dap_http2_stream.c` - Stub implementations
- `net/client/dap_http2_session.c` - Stub implementations

### Next Immediate Steps
1. Implement basic constructors/destructors
2. Implement HTTP parsers (client/server modes)
3. Implement callback system
4. Add SSL/TLS integration
5. Performance testing

### Key Questions Resolved
- ❓ Multiple streams? → NO, single stream with temporal separation
- ❓ Protocol switching? → Callback replacement
- ❓ Client vs Server? → Universal structures, callbacks define role
- ❓ Performance? → Composition approach (1+N calls)
- ❓ Cyclic dependencies? → False problem, normal working references
- ❓ Autonomous streams? → YES, server mode needs this
- ❓ Cancellation logic? → Immediate socket close

### Branch Info
- Branch: `bigint` (from git status)
- Workspace: `/home/demlabs/Projects/cellframe-node/dap-sdk`
- Modified files ready for commit

### To Resume Conversation
1. Read this file + HTTP2_CLIENT_ARCHITECTURE.md
2. Review the 3 header files to understand current API
3. Continue with implementation of constructors/destructors
4. Ask about specific implementation details
